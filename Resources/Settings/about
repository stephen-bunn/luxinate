Luxinate utilizes youtube-dl, ffmpeg, terminal-notifier, and 
cocoadialog in an Alfred-2 workflow. This workflow allows the 
user to download video and audio from popular media sites.

Although youtube-dl's list of media extractors are vast, 
working sites are listed below:
	
	- YouTube
	- SoundCloud
	- and others... 

Current Features:
	
	- Lux 
		This option allows the user to input a URL to
		a YouTube video or a SoundCloud track and
		download the media as video or audio.
	
	- LuxSafari 
		This option allows the user to scan the current
		open tabs of the user’s safari browser and select
		the open media they wish to download.
	
	- LuxChrome 
		Same as LuxSafari, but with Chrome.

	- LuxYouTube 
		Allows the user to query YouTube directly by title
		and either download the media or open the url.
		(Thanks to Simon Storving for the base query code)

	- LuxSoundCloud
		Allows the user to query SoundCloud directly by
		track name and either download the media or open
		the url.

	- LuxPlaylist 
		Allows the user to enter the url of a playlist on
		YouTube, and then download the entire playlist’s 
		video or audio.

	- LuxSettings
		Opens an option panel including options that customize
		the user interaction and advanced settings of
		Luxinate.
